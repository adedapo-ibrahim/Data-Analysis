👤 About Me

I am a data analyst focused on solving complex business problems using data-driven insights. My work bridges the gap between raw data and executive strategy, using tools like Excel, Pivot Tables, and PowerPoint to diagnose operational crises, optimize staffing, and detect financial risks.

📂 Project Case Studies

1. Hospital Operational Crisis Analysis

Domain: Healthcare Operations | Tools: Excel, Pivot Tables

The Challenge: A general hospital was facing overcrowding, financial loss, and lab failures despite high patient volume.

Key Insight: Identified a 35% failure rate in lab tests (19,425 inconclusive results) causing a $707M revenue bottleneck with Medicare.

Outcome: Proposed a ward reallocation strategy to fix the bed shortage (1,693 pediatric patients vs. 20,000+ geriatric patients).



2. Supermarket Strategic Review 2025

Domain: Retail Strategy | Tools: Excel, Market Segmentation

The Challenge: Assessing the ROI of membership programs and marketing across three major cities (NY, Chicago, Austin).

Key Insight: Discovered the "Membership Program" had zero ROI, with members spending $31,819 vs. non-members spending $31,823.

Outcome: Recommended abandoning universal staff rostering in favor of city-specific peak hour scheduling (Morning for Chicago, Evening for NY).



3. Transaction Performance & Risk Audit

Domain: Fintech & Banking | Tools: Fraud Analytics, Network Performance

The Challenge: Investigating a drop in transaction approval rates and justifying premium network infrastructure costs.

Key Insight: Exposed a "Fraud Leak" where 1,644 flagged transactions were successfully processed, and proved that premium "Network Slicing" offered <1ms latency improvement for a massive cost.

Outcome: Recommended immediate cancellation of premium network plans and a "hard block" on fraud flags to stop chargebacks.
